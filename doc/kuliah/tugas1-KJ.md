. OSI LAYER



What is the OSI LAYER?

OSI layer is a standard of communication that is applied in the network computer that causes the entire communication tools can be interconnected memlaui network, the OSI model describes how information from a software application in an komukasi switch through a network media kesuatu other dikomouter application software.



The OSI model is a conceptual layer becomes terbgi in seven layers:



1. the Application Layer is the exchange of information between the programme komukasi, e-mail service to programs running on the network, the apliacation function anatarmuka layer with the functionalism of the network, manage your applications can access the network and create a message-the error message.

2. mendefinisakn data Presentatio is about to be transmitted by the application into a format that can be ditransimisikan through the network.

3. the Session was to define how connections can be created, selected, destroyed.

4. Transport is facilitating the data into packets of data and provide the sort number so it can be reassembled.

5. Network is to define the IP addresses, create header for packets and then routing internet memlaui working by using layer 3 routers and switches.

6. Data Link is to memnentukan how bit-bit dta grouped into dosebut format frame.

7. Physical is to define transmission medium jarigan, network architecture, network topologies and cabling.


2. TCP/IP


What is TCP/IP?


TCP/IP is a communication standard used by internet kominitas in the process of Exchange data from one to another in the network keomputer compuer inetrnet, TCP/IP is a standard open network that is independent of the physical network trasnport mechanism used so it can be used anywhere.



3. ARP


ARP is a protocol used by IPV4. This ARP mapping inetrnet Protocol IP address to network hardware address that is used by a data link protocol. The router can send data cross the path of logic. consisting of a variety of data Link (LAN/Network), with pickles reading and processing the IP address on the package. Packages sent passing each data link with the show mengkapsulasikan packages into the frame. the use of data link identifier in a way are sent to destination kesuber didala link (Neywork).
